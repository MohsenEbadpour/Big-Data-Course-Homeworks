# Big Data Course Homeworks
Welcome to my Big Data course homework repository! This repository contains my solutions and implementations of homework assignments from the spring 2023 semester at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT). I had the privilege of learning from Professor Mostafa H. Chehreghani and excelled in the implementation aspect of the course, achieving the highest scores.

## Overview

In this course, I delved into the fascinating world of Big Data. I worked on various assignments that enhanced my understanding of big data theory, mapreduce architecture, data stream, frequent itemset mining, association rules, tree mining, local sensitive hashing, stream classification, dimension reduction(SVD,CUR), recommender systems, decision tree (on stream), DGIM algorithm, Bloom-Filter, sketching and etc. The repository showcases my efforts and solutions throughout the semester.

## Course Structure

The Big Data course comprised the following components:

- **Homework Assignments**: There were three main homework(project) assignments, each covering different topics and challenges related to Big Data. These assignments helped me develop practical skills in implementing Big Data techniques.

- **Final Project**: For my final project in the mentioned course, I undertook the task of implementing(from scratch) and experimenting with current and new datasets based on the research paper titled "An Adaptive Clustering Algorithm Based on Local-Density Peaks for Imbalanced Data Without Parameters." More details are available on my other repository. 

- **Examinations**: The course included only a final exam to assess my theoretical understanding of the subject.
